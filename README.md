Arduino Based Turbo Adapter for Gamecube

This repository is currently just for hosting the files I had for making my adapter.  If you want to make your own, you'll have to figure it out based on what's here.  
It also doesnt want to work unless it's a controller -> adapter -> console setup. Having anything else between in the chain prevents it from working correctly.

This adapter uses the Z button to send a button press turboed up to 30 times a second.  
Which button is turboed and how fast is it turboed is configured using the buttons on the adapter.  
The adapter has a display to show what the current settings are.
